# NeuralNetwork-BrainActivityRecognition

This is the data base where we have pulled the dataset from: http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets 
We are working with the following data set: 20. ECoG-based BCI based on cognitive control (011-2015)
This is the pdf, that explains the dataset: https://lampx.tugraz.at/~bci/database/011-2015/description.pdf

Outline Research Paper:
Brief Intro to BCIs:
•	Three Components: (joao)
  o	Recording 
  o	Processing Data
  o	Classifying the Data
•	What can it be used for?
  o	Science
  o	Technology
•	The future

Classification 
•	What is it? (joao)
  o	What is it used for?
  o	What can be used?
    	Neural nets
    	Maybe others
•	Using Neural Networks (joao)
  o	Components/ Structure
  o	Is there a preferred setup for BCIs? (Needs more research)
  o	Activation Function 
    	Tanh vs. sigmoid vs. ReLU: the shift in the recent years
    
Data we are working with
•	Briefly discuss the data being used
  o	Dr. Mwaura: “Data always tell a story”
•	Using Neural Networks (our implementation)
  o	Components/structure
•	Activation Function
  o	The use for ReLu and tanh functions. 
  o	Compare and contrast
•	Results 
  o	Compare raw data vs. classified data
Conclusion
  •	What have we learned?
  •	Plans for next semester
